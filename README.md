## What are we planning to build
    
    An Android app to provide help in after flood regulation and management by different NGO's and Goverment organisations. 


## How does it work

    * The App takes some basic information from user and permission to monitor the user mobile's GPS location. 
    
    * The App is able to provide instructions for emergency situations.
    
    * The App will ALERT the user about any nearby floods (in a specified diameter from location of user).
    
    * If user's GPS location and coincide with flood region for more than a specified period of time, the app will alert user and will switch to emergency mode. 
    
    * In case emergency mode activates (which can be determined by either user input or the monitored GPS position or both) app sends the user's basic information and GPS location to a different database consisting of other user's data that are affected by the same.This database can then be provided to different Goverment authorities and NGO's concerned with helping the flood victims.
    
    * Also, the App would forward the details and GPS coordinates of the person along with a SOS message through SMS to a list of contacts (provided by user), this feature will also help the one with poor or no internet connectivity.
    


## How users can get started with the project

    * First user will install the app.
    
    * User will asked permission to allow using Real-Time GPS location while installing the app along with basic permissions.
    
    * User will be required to provide basic details (during first time login) about him/her which will be shared with appropriate agencies in case of emergency.
    
    * User will be asked to provide the list of contacts which will be sent the SOS during an emergency.
