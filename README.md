## What are we planning to build
    
    An Android app to provide help in after flood regulation and management by different NGO's and Goverment organisations. 


## How does it work

    * The App takes some basic information from user and permission to monitor the user mobile's GPS location. 
    
    * The App is able to provide instructions for emergency situations.
    
    * The App will ALERT the user about any nearby floods (in a specified diameter from location of user).
    
    * If user's GPS location and coincide with flood region for more than a specified period of time, the app will alert user and will switch to emergency mode. 
    
    * In case emergency mode activates (which can be determined by either user input or the monitored GPS position or both) app sends the user's basic information and GPS location to a different database consisting of other user's data that are affected by the same.This database can then be provided to different Goverment authorities and NGO's concerned with helping the flood victims.
    
    * Also, the App would forward the details and GPS coordinates of the person along with a SOS message through SMS to a list of contacts (provided by user), this feature will also help the one with poor or no internet connectivity
